1. **Understanding Brain Connectivity**: Network neuroscience aims to map the endogenous activity generated by neurons. The brain is modeled as a graph where nodes represent anatomical brain regions connected by edges referring to morphological, functional, or structural connectivities. Graph alignment can help understand these connections and their changes over time.
2. **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)**: GNNs provide a way of learning the deep graph structure of the brain. They are rapidly becoming the state-of-the-art, leading to enhanced performance in various network neuroscience tasks. Applications include missing brain graph synthesis and disease classification.
3. **Brain Graph Integration**: Graph alignment can be used for integrating brain graphs from different modalities: morphological, structural, and functional. This integration can deepen our understanding of the brain’s topographic organization.
4. **Neurological Disorder Diagnosis**: By understanding the relationship between brain connectivities at a first timepoint and its follow-up acquisitions, graph alignment may produce novel diagnostic tools for better identifying neurological disorders at a very early stage.
