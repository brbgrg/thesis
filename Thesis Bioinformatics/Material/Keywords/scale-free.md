The scale-free nature is reflected in the degree distribution of these networks that obeys the powerlaw distribution, where most nodes have a small number of connections and a few nodes have a large number of connections. This characteristic demonstrates that a few nodes represented as biomolecules play a key role in the dynamic changes of biomolecular networks (Zhang et al., 2021)
