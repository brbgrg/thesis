Existing research on biomolecular networks has proved that many biomolecular networks have the properties of [[sparseness]] and [[scale-free]] nature. (Zhang et al., 2021)

For the problems of [[sparseness]] and [[scale-free]] nature of biomolecular networks, two methods—[[dropout]] and [[regularization]]—can be adopted to alleviate the [[overfitting]] caused by them. (Zhang et al., 2021)
