### Aim
- the principal aim of this study was to investigate ==age-related changes== of the **human connectome modular organization**
	- investigating the evolution of the properties of temporal multilayer networks
	- by developing and applying a novel ensemble multi-layer approach
	- provide a plausible description of the evolution of the connectome’s modular structure during a large portion of the lifespan
- here, we are interested in an intermediate regime, in which modules reconfigure across longer time periods, while also remaining robust across shorter time periods
	- we aimed to find any relationship between age and segregation of the brain subnetworks
		- analyze modularity Q
	- quantify the extent to which modular structure changes with age
		- layer flexibility Fl
	- and which brain regions are more likely to change community membership (modular allegiance)
		- node flexibility Fi 
	- examined how structural modules are topographically distributed on the cortical surface across the lifespan
	- characterize the integration of the different brain areas with respect to the whole network and the modules to which they belong
		- participation coefficient p_i


### Method

- our study attempts to track multiple variables in a large, multi-modal dataset
- every approach used to detect changes in some variables must distinguish between meaningful trends and statistical noise
- we tackled this challenge by implementing a probabilistic scheme, based on bootstrapping, that extracts an ensemble of multilayer networks, where layers represent homogeneous and contiguous age intervals
#### generating the ensemble of multilayer networks
- For this purpose, we processed diffusion MRI data of the NKI dataset and implemented a probabilistic procedure to obtain an ensemble of multilayer networks representative of the ==anatomical connectome== at different ages. 
	- Each layer represents a mean model of structural connectivity in an age range covering 2 years. 
	- Since the participants ranged from 7 to 85 years old, we obtained multilayer networks constituted by 39 age-dependent layers (Fig. 1).
- We generated an ==ensemble of 1000 such multilayer networks==, 

#### identifying modules
- we identified their modular structure through a ==multilayer modularity optimization algorithm==, obtaining for each layer the brain regions’ **community assignment**. 
	- The output of this algorithm depends on two parameters defining spatial and temporal resolution, γ and ω. 
		- ω = inter-layer coupling

#### parameter tuning
- Among the **parameter values** we considered for γ and ω we identified a combination that returns a multilayer community structure with a biologically ==plausible number of modules== that exhibit a ==reasonable rate of reconfiguration== on a physiological time scale. 
	- omit ω values producing communities that do not consistently vary across the layers, or whose variation rate is excessively high even over networks representing close ages.
	- consider γ values producing partitions with a number of clusters (and their size) consistent with the number of large-scale anatomical and functional subnetworks derived in previous work (around ten).
		- allows us to relate them to previously established subdivisions of the brain into functionally specialized systems
- We ==tuned== both parameters in order to examine partitions at different ==spatial and temporal scales==, which affect the number of clusters, their size, and their reconfiguration rate across the lifespan.
	- temporal scale:
		- high ω (ω = 1, 5), could highlight possible structures that do not change over the lifespan.
			- stable communities that span several layers
			- partitions appear barely variable, even at the extremes of the lifespan
			- VI between two partitions r and s is low
		- low ω (ω = 0.1), could represent community structure expressed in specific age ranges. 
			- communities that rarely cover multiple layers
			- partitions respectively appear highly variable, even between consecutive layers
			- dissimilarity score between two general partitions r and s is high
		- Here, we are interested in an ==intermediate regime== (ω = 0.5), in which modules reconfigure across longer time periods, while also remaining ==robust== across shorter time periods.
			- communities tend to be similar along the main diagonal of the matrix (VI $\approx$ 0), namely along consecutive years of the lifespan, but they diverge more and more farther away from the main diagonal
	- spacial scale:
		- γ = 2 most closely resembles the number of large-scale anatomical and functional systems derived in previous studies
			- on average 9–12 clusters made of 8–12 nodes each
			- produces continuous variations in cluster sizes
			- number of communities increases with age
		- $γ \le 1$
			- γ = 0.5 yielded 2–3 modules comprising about 40–60 nodes each
			- γ = 1 we obtained partitions made of 4–6 modules composed of 20–30 nodes.
			- number of communities decreases with age
		- lower γ-values produce partitions with only few clusters which can be trivially reduced to the two hemispheres 
		- higher values of γ lead to larger numbers of communities composed of few nodes, which do not match with established schemes for functional systems in the human brain.
- we restrict the following investigations on the multilayer modular structure identified by optimizing the multilayer modularity in the subset of parameters $[γ = 2, ω = 0.5]$

### Measures
- ==Variation of Information== (VI) matrices obtained for each tested parameter combination
	- VI matrices are square matrices of dimensions equal to the number of layers (i.e. 39), in which each entry represents the distance between layer r and layer s. 
	- They allow us to visually evaluate the similarity of partitions across layers.
- ==node flexibility==, fi, represents the percentage of partitions in which node i changes its community allegiance. It allows us to quantify the **strength with which brain regions reconfigure across the lifespan**.
- The ==layer flexibility==, fl, is measured between all the pairs of consecutive partitions and captures the average node flexibility between such partitions. It enables us to investigate the possible existence of **age stages in which brain modular organization strongly rearranges**.
- ==single layer modularity== Q, computed both for our actual model (Qobs) and for the null model (Qnull), returns an estimation of the extent to which communities are internally connected or segregated one from another.
- ==participation coefficient== p_i of a node quantifies how uniformly distributed its connections are across modules. 
	- The smaller it is the more the node interacts exclusively with other nodes of the cluster to which it belongs

### Testing significance and robustness
- We verified the significance of the temporal evolution of these measures through a comparison with a temporal ==null model== 
	- built an ensemble of null-case multilayer networks following steps a) and b) of section 2.2 and then randomly permuted the network’s layers within each iteration
		- time is scrambled by randomly permuting the net work’s layers
	- test whether results obtained from the ensemble of lifespan multi-layer net works were robust against permutations of the age structure of the data
		- within each time point, we statistically compared the distribution of the values of the indices computed on the actual model with those computed in the null model
		- We made this statistical comparison through a ==permutation test==, with 100.000 permutations and a significance α = 0.05
		- We could perform this temporal validation thanks to the 1000 replications that we had available for both models, which resulted in two different distributions of the communities-related indices (for each layer)

### Results and plausible causes

- results obtained in this study confirm that the human connectome’s modular structure is age-dependent
- results agree with previous findings
- Some brain regions appeared to be less prone to age-related changes
	- low flexibility  
	- non-age-related values of the participation coefficient
- brain areas which reconfigure most across the lifespan 
	- high nodal flexibility
	- age-related values of the participation coefficient
	- reconfigure in different ways
- alterations found on structural organization might underpin functional age-related alterations observed in the same areas
- network becomes more segregated with years, with the appearance of hemispherically-specific modules
- the number of intra-cluster edges decreases with age, while their weight increases, causing non-linear trends of modularity and participation coefficient
- overall, the modules’ reconfiguration rate increases with age

#### Modularity
- number of clusters increasing with age
	- from 9 in the early lifespan to 12 in the late lifespan
- as a consequence, their size decreases
- increased modularity Q (wrt null model) observed at the extremes of lifespan
	- metric of modularity exhibits an age-related U-shaped trend (non-linear)
- causes:
	- Q is proportional to the difference between the within module weights of the network and those in the configuration null model multiplied by γ, within each cluster
	- in the early lifespan modules are internally densely connected
		- higher number of intra-clusters edges in early lifespan 
	- in the late lifespan they are internally strongly connected
		- higher weights of intra-custers edges in late lifespan

#### Layer and node flexibility
- flexibility of brain regions linearly increases with age 
	- modular organization tends to reconfigure more and more as age advances
- causes:
- differences in the modules composition
	- observed only between the last and the first two age groups, but not between the first two

#### Topological distribution on the cortical surface of structural modules  
- linear drop of inter-hemispheric modules
- causes:
	- drop of inter-hemispheric connections
	- physiological age-related shrinkage of the corpus callosum

#### Participation coefficient 
- inverted U-shaped curve followed by the participation coefficient
	- positive correlation with age: nodes become more integrated in the network
	- negative correlation with age: nodes become more segregated
- causes:
	- inverted U-shaped trend observed for the number of inter-clusters connections
