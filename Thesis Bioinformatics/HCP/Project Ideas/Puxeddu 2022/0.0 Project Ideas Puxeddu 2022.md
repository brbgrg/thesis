- multi- layer modularity maximization model ( Mucha et al., 2010 ). One of the greatest advantage of this model lies in its flexibility, and previous work demonstrated that one can easily modify its skeleton to address specific question of neuroscience ( Zamani Esfahlani et al., 2021).
	- can I use it to study neurological diseases?

### where does the network alignment come into play?
- In the context of brain network analysis, multi-layer network models can be constructed ... to establish ==node correspondence across networks representing different subjects’ brains== ( Betzel et al., 2019 )
- layers correspond to estimates of the same network at different points in time, individuals, or connection modalities
	- in this study, individuals
	- multiple single-subject SC and FC matrices from the NKI can be averaged across subjects to form ==group representative networks==
		- how easy is it to link nodes across representative networks?
- nodes are linked to themselves across layers through the resolution parameter 𝜔 (Fig. 1a). Its value affects the homogeneity of communities across layers (indicated through 𝑟 and 𝑡), in a way that small 𝜔 values emphasize layer-specific modular structure, while big 𝜔 values point out communities shared across layers (Puxeddu et al., 2019)
