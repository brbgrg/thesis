- extended model, that allows for a simultaneous tracking of inter-subject and inter-modality features
- Our multi-subject and multi-modal modularity is meant to detect modules of different sizes and more or less consistent across subjects and types of connectivity
- The parameters 𝛾 and 𝜔, are responsible for modulating the number of clusters and homogeneity of the partitions across subjects (Figure S3). We showed that the coupling between structural and functional modules is analogously governed by 𝜂.
- we adopt the approach to set 𝑃𝑖𝑗𝑟𝑓 = 1 for all 𝑖,𝑗, 𝑠, 𝑓. This is referred to as uniform null model, and it has been shown to be a good model to deal with correlation matrices (Bazzi et al., 2016; Traag et al., 2011), resulting in communities with well-known topographic features. 
- Since functional networks are rendered as temporal correlation matrices, and we converted anatomical networks into structural correlation matrices, we could use the uniform null model in all the network’s layers
