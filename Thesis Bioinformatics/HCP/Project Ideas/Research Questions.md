Consider the papers "The modular organization of brain cortical connectivity across the human lifespan" (Puxeddu 2020) and "Multi-modal and multi-subject modular organization of human brain networks" (Puxeddu 2022). I have a dataset made like this: SC: structural connectivity (MRI) FC: functional connectivity during resting state (fMRI) young = 10 y.o. adult = 30 y.o. old = 70 y.o. SC and FC contain 5 different subjects for each age group e.g.: sc.young has dimension 200*200*5 --> nodes*nodes*num_sbj. I want to do a university project based on these papers. I would like to use network alignment in my project. Tell me some research questions that I can tackle in my project using this dataset.

### Research Questions:

1. ==**Age-Related Changes in Network Modularity:**==
    
    - **Question:** How does the modular organization of brain networks differ across age groups (young, adult, old)?
    - **Approach:** Use network alignment to compare the structural (SC) and functional connectivity (FC) networks of different age groups to identify shifts in modularity patterns.
2. ==**Structural-Functional Network Alignment:**==
    
    - **Question:** How do structural and functional brain networks align within and across different age groups?
    - **Approach:** Investigate the alignment between SC and FC within each age group (e.g., SC.young vs. FC.young) and between different age groups (e.g., SC.young vs. FC.adult).
3. **Developmental and Degenerative Patterns:**
    
    - **Question:** What are the key developmental and degenerative changes in brain network connectivity from youth to old age?
    - **Approach:** Identify specific regions or modules that show significant changes in connectivity and modularity from youth (10 y.o.) to adulthood (30 y.o.) to old age (70 y.o.) through network alignment analysis.
4. **Consistency of Modular Structures:**
    
    - **Question:** Are there consistent modular structures across different subjects within the same age group?
    - **Approach:** Use network alignment to assess the consistency of modular structures in SC and FC across the five subjects in each age group.
5. ==**Cross-Modal Comparison:**==
    
    - **Question:** How do the modular structures in structural connectivity relate to those in functional connectivity across the lifespan?
    - **Approach:** Compare SC and FC modular structures in each age group using network alignment techniques to identify common and distinct modules.
6. **Inter-Subject Variability:**
    
    - **Question:** How does inter-subject variability in brain network modularity change with age?
    - **Approach:** Examine the degree of alignment between individual subjectsâ€™ networks within each age group to quantify variability.
7. **Impact of Aging on Network Integration:**
    
    - **Question:** How does aging affect the integration and segregation of brain networks?
    - **Approach:** Analyze the integration and segregation metrics of SC and FC networks across different age groups through network alignment.

### Detailed Project Ideas:

#### 1. **Comparative Analysis of Modularity:**

- Perform a comparative analysis of the modular structures in SC and FC networks across the three age groups.
- Use community detection algorithms to identify modules within each network and apply network alignment methods to compare these modules across age groups.

#### 2. **Longitudinal Study of Brain Connectivity:**

- Create a longitudinal framework to track changes in brain connectivity over the lifespan using your cross-sectional dataset.
- Align the networks of each age group to investigate continuous patterns of change in modular organization.

#### 3. **Network Alignment Techniques:**

- Implement different network alignment techniques (e.g., graph matching, joint embedding) to assess their effectiveness in aligning SC and FC networks within and across age groups.
- Evaluate which techniques provide the most meaningful insights into the modular organization and its changes over the lifespan.

By addressing these research questions, you can explore the modular organization and its evolution in human brain networks, leveraging the dataset you have and the insights from the referenced papers.
