Another line of ML-based generative models have been implemented via graph integration [29]–[32]. The integration aims to generate a ==representative template of a population of brain muligraphs== with a shared neurological state (e.g., autistic). This generated connectional brain template (CBT) encodes a holistic mapping of shared traits within a population of brain multigraphs. 

Later on, [34] proposed an alternative to brain graph embedding in the geometric space by learning the coalescent ==embedding== of brain connectivities in the ==hyperbolic space==. The proposed method successfully segregated the brain graph into spatially distinct subgraphs representing the brain lobes. Mainly, the proposed work represents the first network geometry ==markers for brain diseases== and the coalescent embedding allowed the detection of geometrical ==pathological changes in the connectomes of Parkinson’s Disease patients== with respect to control subjects.
[35], [36] have further demonstrated the hyperbolic geometry has led to valuable mapping of brain graphs, where an essential finding is that the closer coordinates in hyperbolic space denoting nodes in the graph the more likely to be connected.

Interestingly, we depict in our study two different groups of models: ==graph-based== and ==population-based models==. In the first group, designed frameworks learn from a brain graph where nodes represent anatomical brain regions and edges denote the morphological, functional or structural connectivities (Figure 5). Conversely, the second group harbours frameworks that take as input a graph of subjects where each node represents a single brain graph (i.e., subject) and each edge quantifies the pairwise similarity between two brain graphs (subjects).
