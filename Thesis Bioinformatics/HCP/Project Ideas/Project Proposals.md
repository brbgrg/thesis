Types of analyses and research lines that require effective analysis and comparison of different connectomes from "Artificial Intelligence and Brain Research" by Patrick Krauss
1. **Structural and Functional Analysis**: Analyzing the structural and functional connectivity of the brain to understand how different brain regions interact and how these interactions give rise to various cognitive functions.
2. **Comparative Connectomics**: Comparing connectomes across different individuals, species, or developmental stages to identify commonalities and differences that can shed light on brain evolution, development, and function.
3. **Disease Research**: Investigating how connectome alterations are associated with neurological and psychiatric disorders. This involves comparing the connectomes of healthy individuals with those of patients to identify disease-specific connectivity patterns.
4. **Plasticity Studies**: Examining how the connectome changes in response to learning, experience, or injury. This includes analyzing how neural connections are rewired during processes such as recovery from brain injury or neurodegenerative diseases.
5. **Developmental Neuroscience**: Studying how the connectome develops and matures over time, which is crucial for understanding normal brain development and the impact of developmental disorders.
6. **Cognitive and Behavioral Correlates**: Linking specific connectivity patterns to cognitive functions and behaviors by comparing the connectomes of individuals with different cognitive abilities or behavioral traits.
7. **Simulation and Modeling**: Using computational models to simulate the connectome and predict the impact of structural changes on brain function, which requires accurate comparisons of different connectomes to validate the models.
These methodologies are essential for advancing our knowledge in areas such as:
1. **Brain Diseases**: Understanding the structural differences in the connectomes of healthy individuals versus those with neurological disorders.
2. **Brain Development**: Studying how connectomes change from infancy through adulthood.
3. **Individual Variability**: Investigating the unique neural wiring in individuals and its correlation with cognitive abilities and behavior​(Artificial Intelligence…)​.

1. Graph Matching Based Connectomic Biomarker with Learning for Brain Disorders
	1. To address these limitations, we propose a graph matching based method to quantify connectomic similarity, which can be trained for diseases at functional systems level to provide a subject-specific biomarker assessing the disease. We validate our measure on a dataset of patients with traumatic brain injury and demonstrate that our measure achieves better separation between patients and controls compared to commonly used connectomic similarity measures.
	2. Sub Graph Matching with NW alignment or do a domain alignment (?)



Salve prof
ho cercato di prendere ispirazione qua e là ma  non mi sento in grado di scegliere in autonomia l'argomento della mia tesi
Mi sono però fatta un'idea di cosa mi piacerebbe studiare, ma le chiedo un'ultima parola su una possibile applicazione del network alignment nel campo della connectomics
I am interested in the field of comparative connectomics, in the area of structural and functional analysis (analyzing the structural and functional connectivity of the brain to understand how different brain regions interact and how these interactions give rise to various cognitive functions). I am especially interested in studying brain diseases (understanding the structural differences in the connectomes of healthy individuals versus those with neurological disorders), brain development (studying how connectomes change from infancy through adulthood) and individual variability (investigating the unique neural wiring in individuals and its correlation with cognitive abilities and behavior​). I would like to have a multi-modal approach, and use network alignment among other methodologies. Can you suggest me some of the most prominent papers to deepen my knowledge in this area?
Nel precedente incontro avevamo stabilito tesi applicativa e che avrei dovuto prendere un paper come punto di partenza e cambiare leggermente la metodologia per migliorarne la comparison fra brain networks
Per ora ero indirizzata sui seguenti papers, di cui sono anche disponibili i dataset
Le volevo chiedere se potesse darmi istruzioni più specifiche perché vorrei iniziare al più presto a fare qualcosa
