- In this work, we aim to investigate how the connectomeâ€™s modular structure evolves during a large part of the lifespan, while addressing these methodological issues. 
- The main objective of this work is to study how the modular organization of the brain connectome evolves during the lifespan.
- The primary focus of this work is on brain network organization from the modular structure point of view
- Our study adds to our current understanding of age-related changes in the organization of the connectome, specifically its modular organization.
- Moreover, our ensemble multi-layer network approach may be useful for future statistically robust investigations of network topology across large imaging or biomedical datasets
