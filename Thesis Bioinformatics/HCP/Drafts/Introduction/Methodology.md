we propose a novel framework, based on multilayer networks (De Domenico, 2017; Kivela et al., 2014; Muldoon and Bassett, 2016; Vaiana and Muldoon, 2018) where layers represent narrow age ranges. The multi-layer model synthesizes connectivity information from multiple subjects, representing these data in a single network model without discarding data from any of the participants. Using this methodology, the variability of connection patterns across layers will be explicitly associated with age and, as a consequence, so will modular structure. Constructing ensembles of multi-layer networks, we systematically track the evolution of modular structure across the life span. Consistent with previous studies, we find an age-related loss of connectivity within modules. Our study adds to our current understanding of age-related changes in the organization of the connectome, specifically its modular organization. Moreover, our ensemble multi-layer network approach may be useful for future statis tically robust investigations of network topology across large imaging or biomedical datasets
