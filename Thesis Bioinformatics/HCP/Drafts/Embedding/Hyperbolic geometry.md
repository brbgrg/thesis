**Hyperbolic geometry**, also known as **Lobachevskian geometry** or **Bolyai–Lobachevskian geometry**, is a fascinating branch of mathematics that deviates from the familiar Euclidean geometry. Here are some key points about hyperbolic geometry:

1. **Non-Euclidean Geometry**: Unlike classical Euclidean geometry, which is based on the familiar parallel postulate (where parallel lines never meet), hyperbolic geometry rejects this postulate. Instead, it introduces a different concept of parallel lines.
    
2. **Parallel Postulate Replacement**: In hyperbolic geometry, the parallel postulate is replaced with the following statement: Given a line and a point not on that line, there are infinitely many lines through the point that do not intersect the given line.
    
3. **Curved Space**: Hyperbolic geometry takes place on a curved surface called the **hyperbolic plane**. This plane has constant negative curvature, which gives rise to its unique properties.
    
4. **Models of Hyperbolic Plane**:
    
    - One way to visualize hyperbolic geometry is through models. Two common models are:
        - **Poincaré Disk Model**: In this model, the hyperbolic plane is represented as a disk, and straight lines (geodesics) are circular arcs that intersect the boundary of the disk at right angles.
        - **Poincaré Half-Plane Model**: Here, the hyperbolic plane is represented as an infinite half-plane. Geodesics are straight lines perpendicular to the boundary.
5. **Differences from Euclidean Geometry**:
    
    - In hyperbolic geometry:
        - The sum of angles in a triangle is always less than 180 degrees.
        - There are infinitely many parallel lines through a point not on a given line.
        - Circles have varying radii and do not behave like Euclidean circles.
        - The area of polygons grows without bound as their sides increase.
6. **Applications**:
    
    - Hyperbolic geometry has applications in various fields, including art (such as M.C. Escher’s tessellations), architecture (designing curved spaces), and physics (relativity theory).
