My dataset consists of 30 brain connectivity graphs:

- **3 Age Groups:** Young (10 y.o.), Adult (30 y.o.), Old (70 y.o.).
- **2 Types of Connectivity:** Structural Connectivity (SC) and Functional Connectivity (FC).
- **5 Subjects per Age Group:** Each age group has 5 SC graphs and 5 FC graphs, making 10 graphs per age group.

Each graph is a 200 Ã— 200 matrix representing connections between 200 brain regions for each subject.
