Due to the high costs of medical scans, patients might have an MRI acquired at one timepoint and lack the follow-up MRI acquisition, or they might lack other scans such as diffusion MRI or resting-state functional MRI. Since brain graphs are derived from medical images, real-world connectomic datasets are usually incomplete. Furthermore, leveraging a small number of graphs for training learning-based models is unfeasible since it results in poor results [60]. Therefore, brain graph synthesis is important for boosting models designed for early disease diagnosis. We review in the three following subcategories all works belonging to the brain graph prediction flavor. This involves methods seeking to predict brain graphs across one of the three dimensions: domain, resolution, and time (Figure 2). The full list of brain graph prediction works is summarized in Table 1 and descriptions for different loss terms are displayed in Table 5 and Table 6.
