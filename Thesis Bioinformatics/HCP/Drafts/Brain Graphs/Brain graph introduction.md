Understanding how the underpinning connections in the biological neural system account for human brain functions has been a preoccupation of researchers for several years [1]–[3]. To accomplish this aim, network neuroscience field has emerged with the aim of mapping the endogenous activity generated by neurons. Particularly, neuroscientists modeled the brain as a graph where nodes represent the anatomical brain regions connected by edges referring to morphological, functional, or structural connectivities relating pairwise nodes [4]–[6]. Conventionally, three types of brain graphs can be defined from different medical modalities: morphological, structural, and functional brain graphs, which are derived from structural T1-weighted, diffusionweighted and resting-state functional MRI, respectively [7]– [11].
