Goal: 
Align nodes of brain networks across different graphs (across subjects or conditions) to understand and compare their structural and functional properties

Focus:
Node correspondence and structural consistency

Techniques:
Spectral matching, GNNs, graph embeddings

Applications:
Multi-subject brain data integration, comparative studies (enabling more insightful analysis of brain connectivity patterns)

Example in connectomics
Aligning brain regions across subjects
