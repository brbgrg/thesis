Graph alignment has been used in the context of the Human Connectome Project (HCP). Here are some ways it has been applied:

1. **Geometric Deep Learning Models**: Geometric deep learning models have been benchmarked and ensembled on the task of learning the HCP’s ==multimodal cortical parcellation== [1](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-87586-2_11). These models help to understand the topographic heterogeneity of cortical organization, which is an essential step towards ==precision modeling of neuropsychiatric disorders== [1](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-87586-2_11).
    
2. **Inter-Individual Functional Connectome Metric**: A graph-matching based metric, known as ==swap distance==, has been used to quantify the distance between pairs of individuals’ functional connectomes (FCs) [2](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.10.03.510660v1.full). This technique has been applied to ==align FCs== between pairs of individuals from the HCP [2](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.10.03.510660v1.full). The swap distance increases with increasing familial distance and subjects’ ages, and it varies with sex and cognitive scores [2](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.10.03.510660v1.full).
    
3. **Transforming Connectomes**: A framework has been proposed to transform connectomes between different parcellations without needing the raw imaging data [3](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-21083-9_12). This transformation is crucial for comparing brain networks across different studies that use different brain parcellations [3](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-21083-9_12).
    
4. **Network Modeling**: Graph measures have been used to characterize the network structure of the human brain, identifying local contributions of individual nodes and connections, as well as the network’s global capacity to integrate information [4](https://humanconnectome.org/study/hcp-young-adult/project-protocol/network-modeling).
In summary, graph alignment techniques have been instrumental in the HCP, aiding in the understanding of cortical organization, quantifying inter-individual differences in functional connectomes, transforming connectomes across different parcellations, and modeling brain networks [1](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-87586-2_11)[2](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.10.03.510660v1.full)[3](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-21083-9_12)[4](https://humanconnectome.org/study/hcp-young-adult/project-protocol/network-modeling).
