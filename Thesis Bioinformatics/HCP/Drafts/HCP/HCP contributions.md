The Human Connectome Project (HCP) has made significant contributions to neuroscience [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Connectome_Project)[2](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/research/research-funded-by-nimh/research-initiatives/human-connectome-project-hcp). The project was launched in 2009 with the goal of building a “network map” to shed light on the anatomical and functional connectivity within the healthy human brain. It also aimed to produce a body of data that would facilitate research into brain disorders such as dyslexia, autism, Alzheimer’s disease, and schizophrenia

The HCP has led to new data models, informatics, and analytic tools that have advanced researchers’ ability to image and analyze brain connections [2](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/research/research-funded-by-nimh/research-initiatives/human-connectome-project-hcp). These advances have played a major role in accelerating progress in the emerging field of human connectomics [2](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/research/research-funded-by-nimh/research-initiatives/human-connectome-project-hcp). The project has also paved the way for a deeper understanding of how our brain circuitry changes as we age or because of psychiatric and neurologic conditions [2](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/research/research-funded-by-nimh/research-initiatives/human-connectome-project-hcp).

Moreover, the HCP has expanded to include the Developing Human Connectome Project (dHCP), which aims to create the first 4-dimensional connectome of early life [3](http://www.developingconnectome.org/project/).

In conclusion, the Human Connectome Project has been a significant endeavor in neuroscience, contributing valuable data and tools to the field and paving the way for ongoing and future research [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Connectome_Project)[2](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/research/research-funded-by-nimh/research-initiatives/human-connectome-project-hcp)[3](http://www.developingconnectome.org/project/).
