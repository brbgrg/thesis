\subsection{Temporal and Spatial Resolution Limitations}
The proposed method could take advantage of the high spatial 
resolution of fMRI and high temporal resolution of
MEG to achieve the highest sex classifcation performance of 85.2%.

\subsection{Interpretability Limitations}
To highlight the importance of the brain ROIs, we introduce the explainable
causal representation to encourage the reasonable node selection process. We
train an explanation model to explain the multmodal graph representation approach based on granger causality.
