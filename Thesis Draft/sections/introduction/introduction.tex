data: functional and structural connectivity matrices from fMRI and MRI. 
task: cross-modality and cross-subject modular comparison 
to detect age-related modular differences, highlighting shared 
and unique brain network components across groups. 
research objective: dynamic brain network learning \cite{Tang2023}
GNN variant: variant with maximum expressing power that performs
well on the task (state-of-the-art baseline with greater test-set
accuracy)
GNN Architecture (Model Selection):
