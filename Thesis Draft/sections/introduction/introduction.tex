data: functional and structural connectivity matrices from fMRI and MRI. 

task: 
- cross-modality and cross-subject modular comparison 
to detect age-related modular differences, highlighting shared 
and unique brain network components across groups. 
-  understanding the relationship between brain structure and function 
across different age groups

focus: 
- age-related modular reorganization: changes in how SC and FC networks are partitioned 
    into modules as people age
- age-related differences in SC-FC coupling: how the relationship between structural and 
    functional modules differs between younger and older individuals
- inter-subject variability in modular structure: subject-specific modular organization 
    and how it changes with age
