Another challenge of the current brain network
dataset is data insufficiency, which will further 
limit the progress of big data mining on brain network studies. 
For example, the current brain network datasets may not be easy 
to utilize for the group difference studies based on the deep 
learning model since the number of networks in a few subgroups 
may not be enough to train the neural networks.
Instead of enlarging the current dataset, technical methods 
in addressing data quantity issues should also be strictly 
considered. These methods include but are not limited to 
data augmentation techniques, fast algorithms for brain 
network constructions from neuroimaging data, multisite 
learning for dataset combinations, and pre-trained model
development. \cite{Tang2023}
