\subsection{Age-Related Changes in Brain Networks}

- decreased FC-SC coupling with aging 
- increased FC variability
- increased inter-subject variability in both SC and FC networks
- decreased modular segregation in FC networks

\subsubsection {Age-Related Changes in Structure-Function Coupling}
Older subjects may exhibit a weaker coupling between SC and FC networks. 
In contrast, young and adult subjects might show stronger SC-FC coupling, 
where structural modules are more predictive of functional modules.

Structural connections may degrade over time, while functional connections maintain 
higher variability, leading to a decoupling of SC and FC modules.

\subsubsection {Modular Reconfiguration with Aging}

Modular consistency in SC networks might decline with age.
Age-related atrophy can lead to disruptions in connectivity for older adults.

The functional networks of older individuals are likely to show greater 
reconfiguration over time. FC becomes more integrated to compensate for the structural decline.


\subsubsection {Variability Across Subjects in Older Adults}
The inter-subject variability in both SC and FC networks is expected to increase with age. 
Older individuals may show more subject-specific modular patterns, as both SC and FC networks 
are likely to deviate more from the typical patterns seen in younger individuals or adults.

\subsubsection{Modular Integration vs Segregation}
In younger individuals, SC and FC networks tend to have more modular segregation, 
meaning distinct brain regions form highly specialized communities. 

In adults, there may be a balance between integration and segregation. 
SC modules may remain stable, while FC modules start to show increased integration.

In older individuals, modular integration increases. FC modules become less segregated, 
indicating more global communication across brain regions. 
This is often observed as a compensatory mechanism to maintain cognitive function as 
structural connections degrade.
