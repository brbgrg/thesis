NetworkX: 
BrainNet Viewer: network visualization techniques 
(e.g., BrainNet visualization as 
demonstrated in \cite{Xia2013}) are sometimes employed to visually
represent distinctions within brain networks \cite{Tang2023}


Keiriz (2018) - Paper describing NeuroCave and related visualization work.
LaPlante (2014) - The Connectome Visualization Utility, which is implemented in Python; repo here.
Margulies (2013) - A paper on connectome viz, highlighting more examples and resources.
NeuroMArVL - Makes network pictures on a brain surface, in a circle diagram, or as a spring-embedding (2D or 3D).
Nilearn - Plenty of brain visualization inspiration to be had here.
Xia (2013) - BrainNet Viewer, which can also be found on NITRC.
