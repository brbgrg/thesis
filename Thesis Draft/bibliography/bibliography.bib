  abstract = {The human brain is a complex network of anatomically interconnected brain areas. Spontaneous neural activity is constrained by this architecture, giving rise to patterns of statistical dependencies between the activity of remote neural elements. The non-trivial relationship between structural and functional connectivity poses many unsolved challenges about cognition, disease, development, learning and aging. While numerous studies have focused on statistical relationships between edge weights in anatomical and functional networks, less is known about dependencies between their modules and communities. In this work, we investigate and characterize the relationship between anatomical and functional modular organization of the human brain, developing a novel multi-layer framework that expands the classical concept of multi-layer modularity. By simultaneously mapping anatomical and functional networks estimated from different subjects into communities, this approach allows us to carry out a multi-subject and multi-modal analysis of the brain's modular organization. Here, we investigate the relationship between anatomical and functional modules during resting state, finding unique and shared structures. The proposed framework constitutes a methodological advance in the context of multi-layer network analysis and paves the way to further investigate the relationship between structural and functional network organization in clinical cohorts, during cognitively demanding tasks, and in developmental or lifespan studies.},

  abstract = {Recent years have shown great merits in utilizing neuroimaging data to understand brain structural and functional changes, as well as its relationship to different neurodegenerative diseases and other clinical phenotypes. Brain networks, derived from different neuroimaging modalities, have attracted increasing attention due to their potential to gain system-level insights to characterize brain dynamics and abnormalities in neurological conditions. Traditional methods aim to pre-define multiple topological features of brain networks and relate these features to different clinical measures or demographical variables. With the enormous successes in deep learning techniques, graph learning methods have played significant roles in brain network analysis. In this survey, we first provide a brief overview of neuroimaging-derived brain networks. Then, we focus on presenting a comprehensive overview of both traditional methods and state-of-the-art deep-learning methods for brain network mining. Major models, and objectives of these methods are reviewed within this paper. Finally, we discuss several promising research directions in this field.},

  abstract = {Understanding the intrinsic patterns of human brain is important to make inferences about the mind and brain-behavior association. Electrophysiological methods (i.e. MEG/EEG) provide direct measures of neural activity without the effect of vascular confounds. The blood oxygenated level-dependent (BOLD) signal of functional MRI (fMRI) reveals the spatial and temporal brain activity across different brain regions. However, it is unclear how to associate the high temporal resolution Electrophysiological measures with high spatial resolution fMRI signals. Here, we present a novel interpretable model for coupling the structure and function activity of brain based on heterogeneous contrastive graph representation. The proposed method is able to link manifest variables of the brain (i.e. MEG, MRI, fMRI and behavior performance) and quantify the intrinsic coupling strength of different modal signals. The proposed method learns the heterogeneous node and graph representations by contrasting the structural and temporal views through the mind to multimodal brain data. The first experiment with 1200 subjects from Human connectome Project (HCP) shows that the proposed method outperforms the existing approaches in predicting individual gender and enabling the location of the importance of brain regions with sex difference. The second experiment associates the structure and temporal views between the low-level sensory regions and high-level cognitive ones. The experimental results demonstrate that the dependence of structural and temporal views varied spatially through different modal variants. The proposed method enables the heterogeneous biomarkers explanation for different brain measurements.},
