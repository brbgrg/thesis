  abstract = {The human brain is a complex network of anatomically interconnected brain areas. Spontaneous neural activity is constrained by this architecture, giving rise to patterns of statistical dependencies between the activity of remote neural elements. The non-trivial relationship between structural and functional connectivity poses many unsolved challenges about cognition, disease, development, learning and aging. While numerous studies have focused on statistical relationships between edge weights in anatomical and functional networks, less is known about dependencies between their modules and communities. In this work, we investigate and characterize the relationship between anatomical and functional modular organization of the human brain, developing a novel multi-layer framework that expands the classical concept of multi-layer modularity. By simultaneously mapping anatomical and functional networks estimated from different subjects into communities, this approach allows us to carry out a multi-subject and multi-modal analysis of the brain's modular organization. Here, we investigate the relationship between anatomical and functional modules during resting state, finding unique and shared structures. The proposed framework constitutes a methodological advance in the context of multi-layer network analysis and paves the way to further investigate the relationship between structural and functional network organization in clinical cohorts, during cognitively demanding tasks, and in developmental or lifespan studies.},

  abstract = {Recent years have shown great merits in utilizing neuroimaging data to understand brain structural and functional changes, as well as its relationship to different neurodegenerative diseases and other clinical phenotypes. Brain networks, derived from different neuroimaging modalities, have attracted increasing attention due to their potential to gain system-level insights to characterize brain dynamics and abnormalities in neurological conditions. Traditional methods aim to pre-define multiple topological features of brain networks and relate these features to different clinical measures or demographical variables. With the enormous successes in deep learning techniques, graph learning methods have played significant roles in brain network analysis. In this survey, we first provide a brief overview of neuroimaging-derived brain networks. Then, we focus on presenting a comprehensive overview of both traditional methods and state-of-the-art deep-learning methods for brain network mining. Major models, and objectives of these methods are reviewed within this paper. Finally, we discuss several promising research directions in this field.},
